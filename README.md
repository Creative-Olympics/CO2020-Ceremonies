# CO-ceremonies

A datapack to config and do ceremonies during the [Creatives Olympics](https://creative-olympics.org/)

The CO are a caritative event that raise over 300â‚¬ for Greenpeace in 2020 and we will try to beat this in 202X

## How to use it?

On reload, only the config team and the minimal setup is created

To have a full instalation, join the `0config` team and run `/trigger reset`

You'll receive the config book, will create all the teams and will activate the entire datapack

In your chat, you'll see a message saying `setup opening / closing` click on the one you want and it will activate the corresponding first join mesage

After that, the book is kinda self explanatory, if you have any doubt on how X works or what Y will do, ask me on Discord [@fantomitechno](https://discord.com/users/563749920683720709)
